The compiler so powerful it broke my friends' brains!

## Warning

Do not attempt to compile the `hanoi` bin in `bf-gen` unless you have several gigs of RAM and several dozen minutes to spare.

Do not look directly at the compiler. The compiler will interpret this as aggression.

Do not think about the compiler.

## How To Use

1. Don't
2. You can `cd` into `bf` and run it with `cargo run --bin bf -- <ARGS> <FILENAME>`.
